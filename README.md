# Call of Duty 2 - Script Documentation
Documentation about all Call of Duty 2 functions and also about [libcod](https://github.com/voron00/libcod) functions.


## libcod
In this documentation you can find a lot, but not all of libcod functions. And you can help us with it!

[Here](https://github.com/voron00/libcod/blob/master/gsc.cpp) you can find almost all libcod functions. Write about missing in [Killtube thread](https://killtube.org/showthread.php?2935-Script-documentation-2) and I'll add it :)
Fully completed categories: Bots, Entity, Exec. In other categories you can find something and describe. 

It's very good opportunity to learn more in libcod :)
